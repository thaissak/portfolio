				<p>Gustavo and Thaissa are together for almost 5 years and just completed their 1st wedding anniversary. They both love to travel and have been to different places around the world but since they started dating they try to do that together. Sometimes even with their furry pets, Chuck and Luke.<br>
				<br>
				Their first big trip together was to New York and both thought at that time how amazing would be to live in that city. Life goes on and 3 years later they were getting an one way ticket with their dogs from hometown SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil to New York city, USA!<br> 
				<br>
				The couple just reached their 30's so they know there's still a lot of places to come but before the next adventure, why not share some of the nice pictures of these amazing places with everyone, right?!</p>
