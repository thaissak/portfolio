			<h2>Beyond work</h2>
			<p id="about_main">I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. Some people find that hard to believe, because of my asian looks (from my japanese grandparents on my dad's side and my chinese great-grandfather on my mom's side) but that's actually quite common in Brazil, we have one of the largest Japanese colonies outside Japan and a big Chinese community as well. I moved to New York in 2014 and lived there for 1 year, an amazing experience but the sunny and beautiful Bay Area is where I call home now! I love to solve problems in a creative manner and make drawings come to life with elegant coding. Here are few more things you may like to know about me:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<div class="collapse_on">
						<img src="images/icon01.png" alt="icon" title="Click me!">
						<h4>I love Legos</h4>
					</div>
					<p class="hidden">I'm in love with Legos since I can remember! I had few different ones when I was little but for the past years I've been collecting themes from my favorite movies and cartoons, among them: The Millenium Falcon from Star Wars, the Tumbler from Batman and The Mystery Machine from Scooby-Doo. I hope one day I can have a big room dedicated to them, so I can keep buying more and more!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="collapse_on">
						<img src="images/icon01.png" alt="icon" title="Click me!">
						<h4>Super Mario is still my favorite video game</h4>
					</div>
					<p class="hidden">I lost count of how many hours I spent playing this game! Back when I had my Nintendo Entertainment System, blowing my cartridge to make it work, through my Nintendo 64 and most recently, my Wii.The only break from Mario was to play Street Fighter but eventually I would go back to my old habit. Now, almost 20 years has past...and I still play Super Mario (nonstop) every now and then, not sure if I'll ever get enough!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="collapse_on">
						<img src="images/icon01.png" alt="icon" title="Click me!">
						<h4>My dog's name is Chuck Norris</h4>
					</div>
					<p class="hidden">So that's a funny story...When me and my husband got our first dog, he didn't have a name for a few days cause we couldn't figure it out what to call him. He was adorable but we didn't want a cute name or something obvious. So one day we decided to name him Chuck Norris cause that way, even though he is super small, he would be respected!<br>PS: We also have Luke (Skywalker) now, but his name wasn't so fun to figure it out as Chuck's</p>
				</li>	
				<li>
					<div class="collapse_on">
						<img src="images/icon01.png" alt="icon" title="Click me!">
						<h4>I love movies</h4>
					</div>
					<p class="hidden">During my free time you can usually find me either watching a movie on TV or at the movie theater. That's probably my favorite thing to do and I can't stay away for too long. I think you can imagine some of the movies I love but, honestly, I'm up for almost all genres and love to watch something that makes me reflect on my own life (thinking on how cool it would be to have superpowers counts right?) and I hate to wait for any sequel...I mean, who likes to wait for a sequel, right?!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="collapse_on">
						<img src="images/icon01.png" alt="icon" title="Click me!">
						<h4>I want to travel the world</h4>
					</div>
					<p class="hidden">I don't know when this started to be a big deal for me, but now that I've been around a bit is just impossible to ignore that there's a whole world out there waiting to be discovered. There's something magical about being around a different culture, contemplating all kinds of views and architectures. So far, Ireland and Greece were my favorite but I'm hoping the next one will be as good or better. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="collapse_on">
						<img src="images/icon01.png" alt="icon" title="Click me!">
						<h4>Fascinated by human behavior, sociology and philosophy</h4>
					</div>
					<p class="hidden">I was fortunate to have philosophy classes during High School and that opened a door that I never intend to close. My taste for philosophical books evolved to human behavior ones and, more specifically, when concerns different cultures, social values and human nature. If I have the time, I will get a new book on the subject and read it nonstop, the last one was Quiet - The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, by Susan Cain.</p>
